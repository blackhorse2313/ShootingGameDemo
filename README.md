# BabylonFpsDemo
A first person shooter with babylonjs

# About
I'm from Hangzhou, China. I wrote a FPS game with babylonjs, but there are still many things to do. I uploaded some complete code to GitHub, and if you're interested, you can always download it, and I'll synchronize the latest code with GitHub in time!
